<h3>Description</h3>
<p> Making fried rice is a breeze with the recipe you'll find below. The process is simple â€” preheat your pan before swirling in oil and aromatics, then add uncooked proteins if applicable. Add in rice and vegetables, vigorously tossing ingredients for that toasty, golden-brown color that signals big flavor.</p>

<li>2/3 cup chopped baby carrots</li>
<li>1/2 cup frozen green peas</li>

<li>3 cups leftover cooked and chilled white rice</li>
<li>1 tablespoon soy sauce, or more to taste</li>
<li>2 teaspoons sesame oil, or to taste</li>
 </ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
